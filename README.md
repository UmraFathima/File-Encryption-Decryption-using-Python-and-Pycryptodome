## Getting Started
"This project involved building a secure file encryption and decryption system using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in Python. Leveraging the `pycryptodome` library, the system ensures data confidentiality by encrypting files with randomly generated keys, which can later be decrypted to restore the original data. The project focused on secure data transmission and storage, providing an efficient and robust solution for protecting sensitive information."
### Installation
* Python 3.x
* pycrypto

You can install the missing dependencies thorugh `pip`
